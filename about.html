        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Hasitha Edirisinghe, a passionate web designer and full-stack software engineer with a knack for both front-end and back-end technologies. With hands-on experience developing enterprise-level web applications using ASP.NET, and crafting stunning websites with WordPress, I thrive in creating solutions that blend functionality and design seamlessly.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as an intern software developer at MIHCM Solutions, where I've honed my skills by building new features and fixing bugs in HR software. As a freelancer on Fiverr, I also specialize in Google Play Store app publishing, giving me a diverse skill set across multiple platforms.</p>
        <p>My dedication to problem-solving and delivering high-quality, scalable solutions is matched by my ability to work collaboratively with teams. I enjoy developing tools that make people's lives easier, whether it's a simple calculator app or a full-fledged inventory management system.</p>
